## Overview

Spiticart was conceived as an e-commerce platform aimed at **delivering diversity from across India** - a marketplace showcasing India's rich heritage of arts, handicrafts, and unique rural products while empowering rural artisans by improving their livelihoods.

The platform was built on the belief that India's vast informal sector of artisans, craftsmen, and small business owners—employing lakhs of people from poor rural backgrounds—had been largely neglected in the e-commerce boom dominated by multinationals and mass manufacturers.

---

## The Challenge

### The Problem We Aimed to Solve

The last few years saw tremendous growth in the e-commerce space in India. However, a small group of multinationals, mass manufacturers, and leading companies captured a vast majority of this growth, leaving behind a huge sector:

- **Small business owners** struggling to reach online customers
- **Rural artisans and craftsmen** with limited market access
- **Traditional Indian products** overshadowed by mass-produced items
- **Age-old crafts** at risk of being lost and forgotten

Despite India's rich cultural heritage—home to the Indus Valley civilization, Mauryas, Cholas, Vijayanagara empires, and the Mughal era—today's generation was barely aware of these art and craft forms. Many traditional crafts were largely lost and forgotten during the colonial era.

---

## The Vision

Spiticart was founded with three core objectives:

### 1. Delivering Diverse and Unique Products from Across India

Create a platform to showcase traditional Indian products, arts, and handicrafts that were being overlooked in the modern e-commerce landscape.

### 2. Promoting India's Rich Heritage of Arts and Handicrafts

Revive interest in traditional craft forms and preserve age-old techniques that were being neglected in the era of fast fashion and cheap mass-manufactured products.

**Key Belief:** As the new generation of India, we should proudly promote our rich cultural heritage and bring back many of these neglected crafts from across the length and breadth of the nation.

### 3. Empowering Rural Artisans by Improving Their Livelihoods

Support artisans who often come from poor backgrounds and work long hours to earn daily wages. Every purchase was envisioned as a small step toward improving their lives.

## Product Focus

The platform curated and showcased traditional Indian handicrafts from various regions:

<!--

## The Artisan-Centric Approach

### Keeping Artisans at the Heart

**Philosophy:** The artisans bring the amazing products to life. The goal was to share their hard work, dedication to craft, and leave a positive impact on their lives.

### Impact on Rural Communities

The most heartwarming aspect of working on this venture was the interactions with the artisans. While it was heartening to see craftsmen preserving age-old techniques, it was also dispiriting to learn about their financial hardships and extremely challenging lives.

**Primary Goal:** Help improve the livelihoods of artisans employed in traditional crafts like Shantiniketan leather, Channapatna toys, and marble carvings. The vision was that widespread adoption of these products in Indian households would empower artisans through economic opportunity.
