# RLHF Illustrated Guide

An interactive web platform that transforms complex Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) concepts into engaging visual learning experiences.

## Overview

This comprehensive educational platform provides:
- Rigorous yet accessible education on AI alignment
- Hands-on interactive elements with real-time visualizations
- 12 complete modules covering RLHF fundamentals to Constitutional AI
- Multiple learning lenses: mathematical, visual, and operational

## Key Features

- **30+ Interactive D3.js Visualizations**: Adjust parameters in real-time and see how algorithms behave
- **4 Analogy Types**: Game Bot, Writing Student, Math Tutor, and Advanced Concepts to make complex ideas concrete
- **Assessment System**: 60+ quiz questions with detailed explanations to reinforce key concepts
- **Production Quality**: Server-side rendering, performance optimized, type-safe architecture

## The Analogy Toolbox

Complex concepts become intuitive through carefully crafted analogies:

- **🎮 Atari Game Bot**: For core RL concepts like policy as game strategy and rewards as score points
- **✍️ Creative Writing Student**: For preference learning where the reward model acts as an editor's taste
- **🧮 Math Tutor Bot**: For reasoning and verification with verifiable rewards
- **🧠 Advanced Concepts**: For constitutional AI and evaluation frameworks

## Curriculum Highlights

### Phase 1: Core RLHF Loop
- Introduction to RLHF and the four-stage pipeline
- Reward Modeling with Bradley-Terry and pairwise preferences
- Policy Gradients (PPO) with trust regions and clipping
- Direct Preference Optimization for offline alignment

### Phase 2: Foundation & Practice
- Problem setup and mathematical definitions
- Instruction tuning with chat templates
- Regularization techniques including KL penalties
- Rejection sampling and Best-of-N methods

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics
- Constitutional AI with principles and self-improvement
- Reasoning training with RLVR and chain-of-thought
- Tool use and function calling with MCP architecture
- Synthetic data, evaluation, and over-optimization
