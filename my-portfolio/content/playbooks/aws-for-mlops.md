### Playbook Overview

A practitioner's reference for AWS services in production ML and GenAI systems. Each category contains service guides with Terraform templates, cost optimization strategies, and decision frameworks.

### A Note on This Playbook

In my 5 years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, I've noticed a significant gap between academic tutorials and the realities of production MLOps. Many guides stop at deploying a model in a FastAPI container, leaving aspiring engineers without the strategic frameworks and practical insights needed for building robust, end-to-end systems.

This playbook is a sincere attempt to provide a practitioner's blueprint for production machine learning, moving beyond the code to explore the critical decision-making, trade-offs, and challenges involved. My goal is to eventually expand this work into a comprehensive, project-based MLOps course.

**Important Disclaimers:**

- **On Authenticity**: The methodologies and frameworks shared here are drawn directly from my professional experience.
- **On Collaboration**: These posts were created with the assistance of AI for diagram, code and prose generation. The strategic framing, project context, and real-world insights that guide the content are entirely my own.
