### Playbook Overview

This playbook distills my end-to-end framework for designing, building, and operating production-grade AI agents. It blends architectural blueprints, operational checklists, and real-world battle scars into a structured guide for technical leaders.

### Who This Is For

- CTOs and Tech Leads preparing to ship their first agent-powered product
- AI Engineers migrating from RAG/Pipelines to agentic systems
- Engineering teams that need an opinionated framework for experimentation, evaluation, and governance


### What You Will Learn

By the end of this playbook you will have:

1. A precise definition of what a true AI agent is (and is not), plus a reusable blueprint for reasoning, planning, and tool integration.
2. A production-ready AgentOps workflow covering instrumentation, observability, evaluation harnesses, and governance guardrails.
3. Frameworks and scorecards that help qualify agent use cases before you commit to building.


### A Note on This Playbook

This playbook is a sincere attempt to provide a practitioner's blueprint for production Agentic AI, moving beyond the code to explore the critical decision-making, trade-offs, and challenges involved.
