## Playbook Overview

This playbook distills my end-to-end framework for designing, building, and operating production-grade AI agents. It blends architectural blueprints, operational checklists, and real-world battle scars into a structured guide for technical leaders.

### Who This Is For

- CTOs and Tech Leads preparing to ship their first agent-powered product
- AI Engineers migrating from RAG/Pipelines to agentic systems
- Engineering teams that need an opinionated framework for experimentation, evaluation, and governance

### How To Use This Playbook

Each chapter combines deep technical guidance with pragmatic best practices. I recommend working through the material sequentially, since later chapters assume familiarity with earlier concepts and shared vocabulary.

### What You Will Learn

By the end of this playbook you will have:

1. A precise definition of what a true AI agent is (and is not), plus a reusable blueprint for reasoning, planning, and tool integration.
2. A production-ready AgentOps workflow covering instrumentation, observability, evaluation harnesses, and governance guardrails.
3. Frameworks and scorecards that help qualify agent use cases before you commit to building.
