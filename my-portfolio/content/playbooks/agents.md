## Course Overview

This playbook distills my end-to-end framework for designing, building, and operating production-grade AI agents. It blends architectural blueprints, operational checklists, and real-world battle scars into a structured learning experience.

### Who This Is For

- Tech leads and founders preparing to ship their first agent-powered product
- ML engineers migrating from RAG/Pipelines to agentic systems
- Product teams that need an opinionated framework for experimentation, evaluation, and governance

### How To Use The Course

Each chapter combines deep technical guidance with pragmatic best practices and includes an accompanying video walkthrough. I recommend working through the material sequentially, since later chapters assume familiarity with earlier concepts and shared vocabulary.

### What You Will Build

By the end of the course you will have:

1. A precise definition of what a true AI agent is (and is not), plus a reusable blueprint for reasoning, planning, and tool integration.
2. A production-ready AgentOps workflow covering instrumentation, observability, evaluation harnesses, and governance guardrails.
3. Worksheets and scorecards that help qualify agent use cases before you commit to building.

### Chapters Included Today

1. **Chapter 1: Agent Fundamentals** – Establishes the core vocabulary, architecture, and evaluation lenses required to spot viable agent use cases.
2. **Chapter 2: AgentOps Lifecycle** – Breaks down the end-to-end operational lifecycle and dives deep into measurement, evaluation, and governance.

Additional chapters—covering multi-agent orchestration, tool marketplaces, and verticalized playbooks—are in active development.
