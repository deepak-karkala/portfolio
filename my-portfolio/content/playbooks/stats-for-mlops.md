### Playbook Overview

This playbook distills essential statistical concepts into a practical framework for ML engineers and practitioners deploying production systems. It bridges the gap between theoretical statistics and real-world MLOps challenges, focusing on what you actually need to monitor models, run experiments, and make data-driven decisions.

### Who This Is For

- ML Engineers building production systems who need statistical foundations
- Data Scientists transitioning from notebooks to production deployments
- MLOps practitioners responsible for monitoring, drift detection, and A/B testing
- Engineering teams that need a practical reference for statistical decision-making

### What You Will Learn

By the end of this playbook you will have:

1. A solid grasp of the statistical foundations: random variables, distributions, moments, and quantiles that underpin all ML monitoring.
2. Practical knowledge of key distributions (Normal, Student-t, Binomial, Poisson, Exponential) and when they appear in production ML systems.
3. A framework for hypothesis testing, statistical distance measures, and how to apply them to detect model drift and data quality issues.
4. A complete playbook for running A/B tests on ML models, from experiment design to statistical analysis.
5. Operational patterns for monitoring production systems, detecting drift, and quantifying uncertainty in model predictions.
6. Decision-making frameworks that incorporate calibration, confidence intervals, and statistical rigor.

### A Note on This Playbook

In my 5 years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, I've noticed a significant gap between academic tutorials and the realities of production MLOps. Many guides stop at deploying a model in a FastAPI container, leaving aspiring engineers without the strategic frameworks and practical insights needed for building robust, end-to-end systems.

This playbook is a sincere attempt to provide a practitioner's blueprint for production machine learning, moving beyond the code to explore the critical decision-making, trade-offs, and challenges involved. My goal is to eventually expand this work into a comprehensive, project-based MLOps course.

**Important Disclaimers:**

- **On Authenticity**: The methodologies and frameworks shared here are drawn directly from my professional experience.
- **On Collaboration**: These posts were created with the assistance of AI for diagram, code and prose generation. The strategic framing, project context, and real-world insights that guide the content are entirely my own.
