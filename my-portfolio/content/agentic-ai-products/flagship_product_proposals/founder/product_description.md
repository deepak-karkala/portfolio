# Founder Studio — “Entrepreneur Copilot (Idea → Build → GTM)”

## 1) Executive snapshot
ICP: solo founders / early teams  
Wedge: 48-hour GTM sprint (ICP → landing page → lead list → outreach drafts)  
Autonomy: copilot + approval-gated external actions

KPIs: time-to-first-landing-page, lead quality/reply rate, experiments/week

## 2) Product experience & UX
Project workspace: sprint board + chat + artifacts + experiment tracker.  
Trust UI: citations for market claims; assumptions board; approval drawer.

## 3) Agent design map
Skills: product strategist, discovery coach, growth marketer, sales ops, finance analyst, risk reviewer  
Subagents: market research (citations), lead finder, landing page builder, experiment designer, ops agent (CRM setup)

## 4) Tool & data plane (MCP-centric)
Search/research, CRM, analytics, artifact store.

## 5) Context engineering plan
Pinned: ICP/UVP/hypotheses/voice; JIT: competitor pages + interviews; decision log for pivots.

## 6) Evals & observability
Rubrics for UVP clarity + outreach quality; regression tasks for pivots.  
Online: time-to-first-success, reply rate lift, cost per validated learning.

## 7) Failure modes & mitigations
| What breaks | Detect | Constrain | Prevent regression |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hallucinated market claims | citation checks | block publish until sourced | adversarial eval pack |
| Spammy outreach | tone rules | drafts-only + approvals | outreach eval suite |
| Tool abuse | rate limits | strict budgets | tool contract tests |
| Founder thrash | overload signals | sprint limits | “one goal per sprint” rubric |

## 8) Governance posture & rollout
External actions approval-gated; audit trail for sources; progressive automation.

## 9) Business case + distribution loops
ROI: time saved + higher conversion via rapid iteration; lower CAC via targeting  
Loops: shareable artifacts; community templates; embedded founder tools


## 10) Where RFT helps

* **End-to-end execution reliability** across multi-week threads (idea → validation → GTM → pipeline).
* **Prioritization policy**: less thrash, more consistent “do the smallest test next.”
* **Sales/marketing workflow quality**: better targeting, cleaner CRM updates, fewer low-quality lead actions.

**What you train on (signals):**

* Trajectories: hypothesis → experiment design → landing copy → outreach → calls → follow-ups → CRM hygiene.
* Graders:

  * Experiment quality rubric (clear hypothesis, measurable outcome)
  * Lead quality scoring + outreach personalization rubric
  * Process compliance (no spam patterns; consent rules)
  * Outcome-based reward where available (reply rate, meeting set rate) *with strong anti-gaming checks*

**Business metrics it can lift:**

* Higher *activation* (founders shipping experiments instead of staying in ideation)
* Higher *qualified lead rate* and *meeting conversion*
* Reduced *time-to-first-revenue* via better sequencing and less wasted work
