# Flagship Agentic Product Proposals
These proposals follow a repeatable structure that demonstrates full-spectrum competence: **product** (wedge, UX, adoption), **engineering** (skills/subagents/tools/context), **reliability** (evals/observability), and **governance** (permissions/approvals/audit/rollout).

---

## Standard Proposal Template
1) Executive snapshot  
2) Product experience & UX  
3) Agent design map (skills/subagents/planner/autonomy)  
4) Tool & data plane (MCP-centric)  
5) Context engineering plan  
6) Evals & observability  
7) Failure modes & mitigations (Detect → Constrain → Prevent regression)  
8) Governance posture & rollout  
9) Business case + distribution loops
