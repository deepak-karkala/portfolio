Andrew Ng,8,2.5,"Former head of Baidu AI Group, Google Brain","If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future",Nov 2016,Harvard Business Review,https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now
Gary Marcus,2,1,"CEO/Founder of http://Robust.AI,cognitive scientist","My own largest fear is that the field of AI could get trapped in a local minimum, dwelling too heavily in the wrong part of intellectual space, focusing too much on the detailed exploration of a particular class of accessible but limited models that are geared around capturing low-hanging fruit — potentially neglecting riskier excursions that might ultimately lead to a more robust path",Jan 2018,Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal,https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631
Francois Chollet,4,2,"Deep learning @google",“People naively believe that if you take deep learning and scale it 100 times more layers and add 1000 times more data then a neural net will be able to do anything a human being can do but that is just not true”,Feb 2018,https://www.wired.com/story/greedy-brittle-opaque-and-shallow-the-downsides-to-deep-learning/
Yann LeCun,6,3.8,VP & Chief AI Scientist at Facebook,"we’re very far from building truly intelligent machines. All you’re seeing now —are very narrow intelligences, and they’re really trained for a particular purpose. Like, yes, in particular areas machines have superhuman performance, but in terms of general intelligence we’re not even close to a rat",October 2017,Verge Interview,https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552056/a-intelligence-terminator-facebook-yann-lecun-interview
Geoffrey Hinton,7,4.2, Google Brain researcher and faculty member at University of Toronto,"It seems to me that there is no other way the brain could work, humans are neural nets, anything we can do they can do … better than [they have] any right to",May 2019,Google I/O developer conference,https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/09/geoffrey-hinton-discusses-how-ai-might-inform-our-understanding-of-the-brain/
Yoshua Bengio,6.25,9,Full professor at Université de Montréal,"I think we need to make it immoral to have killer robots. We need to change the culture, and that includes changing laws and treaties. My answer is that one, we want to make them feel guilty for doing it, and two, there’s nothing to stop us from building defensive technology. There’s a big difference between defensive weapons that will kill off drones, and offensive weapons that are targeting humans. Both can use AI",Nov 2018,MIT Tech Review interview,https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612434/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/
Pedro Domingos,3,1.5,Professor at the University of Washington,"A self-driving car can drive millions of miles, but it will eventually encounter something new for which it has no experience",Feb 2018 Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/
Bill Gates,9,8,Principal founder of Microsoft Corporation,"I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern",Jan 2015,Reddit AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tzjp7/hi_reddit_im_bill_gates_and_im_back_for_my_third/co3r3g8/
Jeff Bezos,7,8.5,"Founder, chairman, CEO, and president of Amazon","I think autonomous weapons are extremely scary. The artificial intelligence tech that 'we already know and understand are perfectly adequate' to create these kinds of weapons said Bezos, 'and these weapons, some of the ideas that people have for these weapons, are in fact very scary'",April 2018,"George W. Bush Presidential Center’s Forum on Leadership",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/11/jeff-bezos-on-ai-robots-wont-take-all-our-jobs.html
Elon Musk,9,9.5,"CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, founder of The Boring Company, co-founder OpenAI, PayPal","It’s capable of vastly more than almost anyone knows and the rate of improvement is exponential. And mark my words, AI is far more dangerous than nukes. Far. So why do we have no regulatory oversight? This is insane. We have to figure out some way to ensure that the advent of digital super intelligence is one which is symbiotic with humanity. I think that is the single biggest existential crisis that we face and the most pressing one",March 2018,"Southwest tech conference, Austin",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/elon-musk-at-sxsw-a-i-is-more-dangerous-than-nuclear-weapons.html
Stephen Hawking,9.75,9,"Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, 1979-2009","The genie is out of the bottle. We need to move forward on artificial intelligence development but we also need to be mindful of its very real dangers. I fear that AI may replace humans altogether. If people design computer viruses, someone will design AI that replicates itself. This will be a new form of life that will outperform humans",Nov 2017,Wired interview,https://hub.packtpub.com/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-quotes/
Mark Zuckerberg,8.5,4,"Co-founder, Chairman and CEO at Facebook","I think that AI is going to unlock a huge amount of positive things whether that’s helping to identify and cure diseases, to help cars drive more safely, to help keep our communities safe",May 2018,"Interview at Viva Technology conference, Paris",https://www.businessinsider.in/Mark-Zuckerberg-responds-to-Elon-Musks-warnings-against-AI/articleshow/64310984.cms
Tim Cook,6,6,Apple CEO,"Advancing AI by collecting huge personal profiles is laziness, not efficiency. For artificial intelligence to be truly smart, it must respect human values, including privacy. If we get this wrong, the dangers are profound",Oct 2018,"Privacy conference in Brussels, Belgium",https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2018/10/24/apple-ceo-tim-cook-issues-ai-warning-it-must-respect-human-values-including-privacy/#76abbcb9584d
Sundar Pichai,7.5,7,Google CEO,"AI is one of the most important things humanity is working on. It is more profound than, I dunno, electricity or fire. ...Concerns about harmful applications of the technology are “very legitimate” — but the tech industry should be trusted to responsibly regulate its use.",Dec 2018,Washington Post interview,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/12/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-fears-about-artificial-intelligence-are-very-legitimate-he-says-post-interview/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ee3598607853
