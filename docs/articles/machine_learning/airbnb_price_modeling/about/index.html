He went on to explain how the machine that defeats the best chess player today may one day go rogue like in numerous Hollywood flicks over the years. The term 'Artificial Intelligence' is one of those polarising ones and for a lot of people working on Machine Learning and AI, concerns over rise of AI is one of those topics that keeps coming up when interacting with people.

            <h3>A Brief history of AI and its past hype cycles</h3>
            <p>
				      The field of Artificial Intelligence took birth during 1950s and since then it has had several ups and downs. The pattern seems to be similar everytime. A certain breakthrough creates a buzz in the research community prompting researchers to make some bold claims. This raises expectations leading to enormous funding. But quite often researchers fail to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they face and their tremendous optimism would already have raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results fails to materialize, funding for AI disappears eventually leading to a bust.

            <h3>Recent years: Why the buzz in recent past ?</h3>
            <p>
              AI has certainly been around for a long time with several peaks and troughs in its hype cycles over the past. But then something changed in 2010s, deep learning - a variant of machine learning which was previously discarded due to its enormous computational and data requirements found a new lease of life. Researchers lead mainly by pioneers of the technique found a way of achieving unprecedented levels of improvements in a diverse set of applications. While the underlying idea of these algorithms was not new but with remarkable improvements in computational resources and availability of huge data, the tech giants could leverage these results and apply them in a number of real world applications such as image understanding, translation, speech recognition, game playing, self-driving etc.

            <h3>The Deep Learning Hype</h3>
            <p>
              All these has lead to an enormous hype around the capabilities of AI over the last few years. So that raises the question, is the current hype any different from those of the past. Will AI in this avatar finally reach its potential of exceeding human level intelligence as potrayed often in pop culture ? In order to understand this, we will need to answer couple of questions first,
              <ol>
                <li>What capabilities does a machine need to have in order to achieve super human intelligence (what is General Aritficial Intelligence) ? </li>
                <li>How does today's Deep Learning systems work and what is limiting them from becoming General Artificial Intelligence ?</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>What is General AI ?</h3>
            <p>
              Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to intelligence of a machine that has the capacity to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It does not refer to human intelligence itself, but it can be like human thinking, may exceed human intelligence and is thereby the primary goal of most research in artificial intelligence. This form of AI is often the one portrayed in science fiction and pop culture. Although there are no specific criteria about the capabilities of such a machine, broadly AGI systems should be able to perform the following tasks,

            The field of AI has seen many hype cycles and has had its ups and downs over the past several decades. The current cycle of AI is dominated by Deep Learning. Driven by rapid rise in computation power and availability of huge datasets, Deep learning has delivered spectacular results over the past decade but like most things it is now approaching the point of diminishing returns. The improvement in results over the last two years have been marginal and the search for new techniques or changes to existing methodology is gathering more and more attention. But unlike the past cycles of AI, the current cycle has also bought unprecedented levels of both optimism and a fear of the rise of AI. Leveraging the huge data, the tech giants have deployed the deep learning systems in a myriad of applications leading to doubt over their dominance and influence over the society. There have also been growing apprehensions about the misuse of AI for military applications.

              In a early 2018 blog titled <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">AI Winter Is well on Its Way</a>, author Flip Pieknniewski compares the inevitability of AI winters with those of stock market crashes, although hard to say when but bound to occur at some point of time. We are currently going through similar phases like with past AI hype cycles, where the expectations are raised but not met, the disappointment will lead to people discard it and chase the next big thing. But the author also makes a valid point of how unlike in the past, this cycle of AI has been fueled by tech giants with deep pockets, so the winter will not freeze and kill the entire field.

              The slowdown has been gradual over the last couple of years but when even the Godfathers of current AI revolution express concerns, we know it is for real. For instance, in an <a href="https://www.axios.com/artificial-intelligence-pioneer-says-we-need-to-start-over-1513305524-f619efbd-9db0-4947-a9b2-7a4c310a28fe.html">interview</a> for Axios, Geoffrey Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto a Google researcher and one of the GodFathers of Deep Learning, said he is now <em>deeply suspicious of back-propagation, the workhorse method that underlies most of the advances we are seeing in the AI field today</em>. Another Godfather, Yoshua Bengio expressed similar concerns in this MIT Technology review <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612434/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/">interview</a>, <em>I think we need to consider the hard challenges of AI and not be satisfied with short-term, incremental advances. I’m not saying I want to forget deep learning. On the contrary, I want to build on it. But we need to be able to extend it to do things like reasoning, learning causality, and exploring the world in order to learn and acquire information</em>. Popular tech magazine Wired published an article that was entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-cars-challenges/">After peak hype, self-driving cars enter the trough of disillusionment</a>, describing how the autonomous driving systems have failed to live up to the expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this article, we learnt what today's AI lacks and how it is still quite far from General AI. The immediate next question is <em>Will we be able to achieve AGI ?</em>, <em>If so when will that be ?</em>, <em>What are the possible future scenarios and what does the future hold ?</em>. In order to answer these, I made a chart with timeline of likely future possibilities. Again the scenarios presented are completely hypothetical and based on a number of expert views, past events and the present situtation of AI research.

            The horizontal axis denotes the timeline and the vertical axis shows the intelligence levels of AI. We are currently at a point of time when Deep Learning has delivered stunning results over last few years and is now at the point of diminishing returns. In the first possible future scenario, the current methodology may hit a roadblock and our AI systems may end up getting limited to capabilities of today's Deep Learning techniques. In the second likely scenario, researchers may find a way of advancing the field of Deep Learning further, improving the results and getting further closer to General AI. In the third likely scenario, following the roadblock of Deep Learning, researchers may come up with an entirely new methodology addressed to overcome shortcomings of today's AI systems and eventually getting much closer to the capabilities of General AI.

            So which scenario will it be ? We will never know, only time will reveal that. Perhaps this was best summarised by Geoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as spearheading the current AI revolution when he used a Max Planck quote in <a href="https://www.axios.com/artificial-intelligence-pioneer-says-we-need-to-start-over-1513305524-f619efbd-9db0-4947-a9b2-7a4c310a28fe.html">this interview</a>, <em>"Science progresses one funeral at a time.' The future depends on some graduate student who is deeply suspicious of everything I have said"</em>. But what we do know is that the current AI systems still lack some of the fundamental requirements in order to achieve or exceed human level intelligence. So we all including my Amsterdam tour guide can relax and not worry about the doomsday scenario and machines overlording over humans. We are not there, just yet.
