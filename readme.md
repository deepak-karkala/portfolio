<b>About Me</b><br/>
After graduating in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at IISc, Bangalore and worked on developing efficient algorithms for image reconstruction in Diffuse Optical Tomography. I then joined a semiconductor startup in Bangalore, where I worked on signal processing algorithms for wireless communication (WCDMA, LTE). In 2018, I completed Masters from EPFL Switzerland with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Science. For my thesis project, I worked on data analytics and anomaly detection in IoT sensor data. I then worked remotely as a Data Engineer for eSMART Technologies, a Swiss company in home automation and building management. Since then, I have become interested in Data-Storytelling, Visualisation and built a number of side projects presented here in my portfolio. Currently looking for full time, contract or freelancing based position as Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Data-Visualisation Engineer or similar roles.
